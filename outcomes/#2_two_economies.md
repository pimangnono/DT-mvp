**Qualitative Strategic Analysis**

Here is the data-driven analysis based strictly on the provided table:

**1. Resilience Verdict:**
Based on the data, neither model demonstrated superior financial resilience in terms of Profit Margin, as both were 0.00. However, the Linear Economy model showed superior short-term financial liquidity with a Cash Flow of 36.00, compared to the Circular Economy's 25.00. Therefore, in this snapshot, the Linear model demonstrated a stronger cash position.

**2. Sustainability as a Strategic Asset:**
The ESG Performance for both models was identical at 60.00, offering no differentiation. However, the Circular Economy's vastly lower Total CO2 Footprint (621.00 kg CO2e) compared to the Linear Economy (5,642.00 kg CO2e) is a critical indicator. This significantly lower carbon dependency implies a reduced reliance on imported commodities, thereby inherently lowering economic risk and increasing long-term resilience to global supply chain disruptions like the 'Global Wheat Supply Disruption' scenario, even if its immediate cash flow was lower.

**3. Policy Insight for Singapore:**
The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) should prioritize and incentivize the development and adoption of local, low-carbon ingredient supply chains, as evidenced by the Circular Economy's significantly lower Total CO2 Footprint (621.00 kg CO2e vs. 5,642.00 kg CO2e), to bolster food security and mitigate vulnerability to future global supply chain shocks.
